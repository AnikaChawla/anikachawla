# Your Name

I am a researcher focused on uncertainty-aware, decision-centric modeling for complex environmental and infrastructure systems. My work examines how uncertainty, model discrepancy, and data limitations shape operational and policy decisions, with the goal of developing methods that make complex models more usable, credible, and decision-relevant.

My research interests sit at the intersection of uncertainty quantification, sequential decision-making, and climate-relevant systems, with an emphasis on translating technical modeling results into actionable guidance under real-world constraints.

## Research (Core Focus)

### Uncertainty-Aware Decision Support for Environmental Systems  
**Focus:** Uncertainty quantification, surrogate modeling, and decision relevance  
**Methods:** Bayesian inference, probabilistic surrogates, sensitivity analysis, sequential decision frameworks  

My research centers on developing modeling and decision-support frameworks that explicitly represent uncertainty and model discrepancy, rather than treating them as secondary outputs. I am particularly interested in how uncertainty propagates through modeling pipelines and affects which actions are considered justified or feasible in practice.

#### Operational Contrail Mitigation (Representative Test Case)  
*Role:* Research lead  
*Context:* Climate-relevant operational decision-making under uncertainty  

- Developed probabilistic modeling approaches to evaluate contrail-avoidance decisions under uncertain atmospheric inputs and imperfect physical models  
- Analyzed when predicted climate benefits are decision-relevant versus dominated by uncertainty  
- Framed contrail mitigation as a representative environmental decision problem involving uncertainty, feasibility constraints, and sequential choices  

*Key takeaway:* Even when technical mitigation options exist, uncertainty and operational constraints strongly influence whether actions are credible and actionable.

#### FAA CLEEN ASCENT — Technology Adoption & Climate Impact  
*Role:* Research assistant  
*Context:* Fleet-level emissions modeling under adoption uncertainty  

- Examined how assumptions about technology adoption and policy scenarios shape fleet-level climate outcomes  
- Evaluated sensitivity of emissions conclusions to modeling and economic assumptions  
- Highlighted the role of adoption uncertainty in translating technological advances into real climate impact

## Selected Collaborative Projects

### Senior Design Project — Systems-Level Design Under Constraints  
*Role:* Systems analysis lead  
*Focus:* Trade studies, feasibility, and decision-making under constraints  

- Led system-level trade studies evaluating competing architectures under performance, cost, and feasibility constraints  
- Integrated subsystem analyses into a coherent decision framework to support final design selection  
- Assessed sensitivity of design outcomes to key assumptions and uncertainties  

*Key takeaway:* Real-world feasibility, uncertainty, and stakeholder constraints often determine outcomes more than technical optimality.

### Machine Learning for Inland Water Quality Monitoring (Course Project)  
*Focus:* Data-driven environmental modeling under limited ground truth  
*Dataset:* AquaSat (satellite reflectance + in situ measurements)

- Conducted model comparisons across linear, tree-based, and neural approaches  
- Identified limits of linear models and gains from nonlinear methods  
- Examined interpretability and uncertainty challenges when using ML outputs for environmental decisions  

*Key takeaway:* Predictive performance alone is insufficient; uncertainty and interpretability remain central for decision support.
